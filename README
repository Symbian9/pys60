		       Series 60 Compatibility

These modules are intended to enable running of many Python for Series
60 scripts on the desktop.  They are based on wxPython.

 * appuifw.py - S60 application user interface framework.
 * e32.py - Symbian OS utilities.
 * graphics.py - 2D graphics primitives.
 * key_codes.py - constants required by the appuifw module.

This software requires wxPython 2.5.3.1 or later, with Unicode support.
It has been tested on Mac OS X 10.4 (which includes wxPython 2.5.3.1),
on Linux (with wxPython built from sources -- see below), and on Windows
(some time ago, sorry).  The graphics module has mainly only been tested
on Linux.

After you have added this directory to your PYTHONPATH, you can try out
some of the example scripts included with Python for S60 (available at
http://forum.nokia.com/python/ or http://sourceforge.net/projects/pys60/):

 * python weather_info.py
 * python SMS_example.py
 * python rssreader.py
 * python ball.py
 * python snake.py

On Mac OS X, you need to use the "pythonw" command instead of "python".

Here is how we built wxPython for Linux:

   cd wxPython-src-2.5.3.1        # Better to use 2.6.x nowadays.
   mkdir bld

   cd bld
   ../configure --enable-unicode
   make
   sudo make install

   cd ../wxPython
   python setup.py build CORE_ONLY=1 UNICODE=1
   sudo python setup.py install CORE_ONLY=1 UNICODE=1
